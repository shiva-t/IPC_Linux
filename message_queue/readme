Code to use Message Queues to demonstrate IPC between a sender and receiver application
Message Queues are suitable for use in scenario with multiple servers and single client. 

A unique string name is needed for the message queue starting with /

Sender Flow:
    mq_open()   --> to open message queue
    mq_send()   --> enqueue the message
    mq_close()  --> release the opened MQ

Receiver Flow:
    mq_open()    --> open the message queue
    select()     --> to wait for meesages being received on MQ
    mq_receive() --> dequeue the message
    mq_unlink()  --> release the opened MQ, kernel can erase it if free
