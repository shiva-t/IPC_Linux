IPC can be acheived using signals on Linux too:
 1. Signal from OS to application, e.g. SIGINT on Ctrl+C
        code1_int.c

 2. Signal that can be raised by an application itself using raise()
        code2_raise.c

 3. Signal raised by one application impacting other : kill()
        code3_kill.c
