Demonstration of IPC using Shared Memory technique
Shared Memory is a kernel resource. Applications can request for it and map into their virtual address space
This IPC way is ideal when there is single publisher and multiple users and large data needs to be shared.
For multiple publishers, synchronisation mechanisms are needed which can increase the time of execution.
