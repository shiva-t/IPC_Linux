Implementation of Unix Socket : Server and client applications
The client initiates connection with the server and sends a set of values to server, the server is expected to add those and return the same.

The server is multiplexed here using select(), multiple clients can request for server services here.
fd_set is the set of file desscriptors, where master file descriptor and data sockets(client handlers) descriptors are stored once connection is established.

Whenever select() is called, it monitors all these file descriptors for any incoming request to server.


Server flow:
============
    socket() --> create master f.d., to take new init req from clients
    bind()   --> above fd is binded to the socket name
    listen() --> server is ready
    select() --> monitors all file descriptors, master and data
                 - accept()          --> for new client connection
                 - read() / write()  --> data exchange on existing fd's
    close()  --> connection with client/master descriptor can be closed
    unlink()

Client flow:
===========
    socket()  --> create data socket for client
    connect() --> initiate connection with server
                  perform read() / write()
    close()
