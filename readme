Linux applications can implement IPC through various methods.
Some of those have been implmented here, using some demo code
The implementations are for:
	1. Unix Sockets: single server, single client
	2. Unix Sockets: Server is multiplexed for multiple client requests
	3. Message Queues
	4. Shared Memory
	5. Signals : OS to application, application to application
